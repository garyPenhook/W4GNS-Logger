## 💡 How to Read the Highlighting

### Red Spot (CRITICAL)
```
VU2OR on 14 MHz → RED
├─ You need 2 more for Centurion (98/100)
├─ You need 12 more for Tribune
└─ This is YOUR MOST NEEDED AWARD
→ WORK THIS NOW!
```

### Orange Spot (HIGH)
```
K4MZ on 7 MHz → ORANGE
├─ You need 5 more for Centurion
├─ You need 22 more for Tribune (THIS IS CLOSEST)
└─ Good opportunity for Tribune progress
→ Worth working if on frequency
```

### Yellow Spot (MEDIUM)
```
W1ABC on 20 MHz → YELLOW
├─ You need 2 more for Centurion (done/not needed)
├─ You need 12 more for Tribune (done/not needed)
├─ You need 55 more for Senator
└─ Not urgent, but contributes to long-term
→ Work if nothing better available
```

## 📍 Hover for Details

```
Spot row → YELLOW highlight

Mouse hover ↓

Tooltip appears:
  "MEDIUM: Need 80+ more for Sideswiper"
```

## 🔄 Color Updates Automatically

When you log a new contact:

1. Contact saved to database
2. Highlighting updates next spot
3. System recalculates award needs
4. Colors adjust accordingly

For example:
- If you log a Centurion member today
- Centurion goes from 98/100 → 99/100
- Red spots might become orange tomorrow

## 📊 What Awards Are Tracked

The system checks YOUR progress for:

✅ **Centurion** - 100 SKCC members  
✅ **Tribune** - 100 Tribune+ members  
✅ **Senator** - 100 Senator members  
✅ **Triple Key** - SK/Bug/Sideswiper (100 each)

---

## 🎛️ Settings Used (Already Configured)

The system automatically reads:

```
Settings → Operator tab:
  Callsign: W4GNS ✅

Settings → ADIF tab:
  My SKCC Number: 14947T ✅
```

No setup needed - it just works!

---

## 🆘 If Not Working

**Check:**
1. Restart app (forces reload)
2. Look at logs for: `award_eligibility_available=True`
3. Verify settings saved (File → Settings)

**That's usually all you need!**

---

## 📈 Awards Progress (For Reference)

Your current status (you can see exact numbers in Awards tabs):

- **Centurion**: 98/100 (need 2 more) ← MOST URGENT
- **Tribune**: 88/100 (need 12 more)
- **Senator**: 75/100 (need 25 more)
- **Triple Key**: SK=78, Bug=99, SS=20 (need 22, 1, 80)

This is why:
- Red spots = mostly for Centurion (need ≤5)
- Orange spots = Tribune related (need 12)
- Yellow spots = Senator or SS (need 25+)

---

## 🎯 Strategy Tips

### To Hit Centurion Fast
👉 **Work RED spots** - Need only 2 more!

### To Progress on Tribune  
👉 **Work ORANGE spots** - These help Tribune next
