## Database Integration Notes

### SKCC Contact Fields
```python
# In Contact model (src/database/models.py:75)
skcc_number = Column(String(20))  # SKCC member number
mode = Column(String(20), default="CW")  # Must be CW for SKCC

# Constraints
# - SKCC contacts are CW-only
# - Validation enforced in repository.add_contact()
# - Query methods automatically filter for CW mode
```

### SKCC Award Tracking
```python
# In AwardProgress model (src/database/models.py)
# Define SKCC awards:
award_program = "SKCC"  # Primary award program
award_name = "Centurion", "Tribune", "Senator", etc.
award_mode = "MIXED", "CW"  # All SKCC is CW
award_band = Specific band or NULL for all-band

# Example queries:
# - Get Centurion progress: award_name="Centurion", contacts with SKCC numbers
# - Get Tribune T-level: award_name="Tribune", mode="T"
# - Get Senator S-level: award_name="Senator"
```

### Repository Methods for SKCC
```python
# Get SKCC contacts (CW-only)
contacts = repo.get_contacts_by_skcc("SKCC1234")

# Get SKCC statistics
stats = repo.get_skcc_statistics()
# Returns: {'total_skcc_contacts': X, 'unique_skcc_members': Y}

# Search by band
band_40m = repo.search_skcc_by_band("SKCC1234", band="40M")
```
