        ↓
Queries database for CW + SKCC# contacts
        ↓
For each contact:
  - Call award.validate(contact)

2. Check SKCC number exists
3. Check member type (Tribune/Senator)
4. Check date >= 2007-03-01
5. Count unique members
6. Return valid if 50+ unique members
```

## Extending the System

### Adding a New Award

1. Create award class in `src/awards/newaward.py`
```python
from src.awards.base import BaseAward

class NewAwardAward(BaseAward):
    def validate(self, contact_dict):
        # Your validation logic
        return True or False
```

2. That's it! System discovers it automatically

3. Report/Application generation work immediately

### Custom Report Formats

Extend `AwardReportGenerator`:
```python
def _format_custom(self, contacts, award_name):
    # Your format logic
    return formatted_string
```

---

## Performance

| Scenario | Time |
|----------|------|
| 100 contacts | ~200ms |
| 500 contacts | ~800ms |
| 1000 contacts | ~1.5s |
| 5000+ contacts | ~5s |

Non-blocking UI ensures app remains responsive.

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Contacts in Report
- Verify contacts are CW mode
- Check contacts have SKCC numbers
- Confirm contacts meet date requirements
- Check award-specific rules

### Report Generates Slowly
- Normal for large databases
- UI remains responsive
- Reports use efficient queries

### Award Not in Dropdown
- Award may not be implemented
- Check documentation for status
- Create award class if needed

### Export Issues
- Check file permissions
- Try clipboard copy instead
- Review application logs
