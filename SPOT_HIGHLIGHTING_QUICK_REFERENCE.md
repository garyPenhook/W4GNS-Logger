### Scenario 1: You're at 98 Centurion Contacts

**Red Spot Alert:** K5XYZ is an SKCC member you haven't worked yet
- **Means:** Working K5XYZ gets you to 99/100 - you're almost there!
- **Tooltip:** "CRITICAL: Need 2 more contacts for Centurion"
- **Action:** Make it a priority!

### Scenario 2: You Just Earned Centurion

**Orange Spots Start Appearing:** K7ABC (Tribune), N6DEF (Tribune)
- **Means:** Now the system is highlighting Tribune members for your next award
- **Tooltip:** "Need 45 Tribune+ members for Tribune award (55/100 current)"
- **Action:** Work these to progress toward Tribune!

### Scenario 3: You're Chasing Triple Key

**Yellow Spots for Bug Users:** N0BUG, K0BUGME, W5KEYER
- **Means:** These help your Triple Key (Bug) goal which is still far off
- **Tooltip:** "Triple Key (Bug): 45/100 Bug users (need 55 more)"
- **Action:** Work them when you have time

## How to Use the Highlighting

### Step 1: Enable Highlighting

In the RBN Spots tab:
- ‚òëÔ∏è Check "Highlight Award-Relevant"
- ‚òëÔ∏è Check "Show Worked" (optional, shows green/gray for reference)

### Step 2: Understand Your Colors

Look at the spot table and use the color coding to prioritize:
- See a **RED** spot? Stop and work it!
- See **ORANGE** spots? Work them between other activities
- See **YELLOW** spots? Good for background goals

### Step 3: Hover for Details

Move your mouse over any highlighted spot to see:
- Full callsign and worked history
- Specific awards that benefit
- Progress toward each award
- How many more contacts you need

Example:
```
üìç K5ABC
‚úì Worked 2 times (1 week ago)

üéØ AWARD OPPORTUNITIES:
  ‚Ä¢ Tribune: 85/100 Tribune+ (need 15 more)
```

### Step 4: Click to Work

Click on a highlighted spot to select it for logging, or just note the info for later.

## Common Questions

### Q: Why isn't a spot highlighted?

**Reasons:**
1. They're not an SKCC member (only SKCC members help with SKCC awards)
2. You've already worked them many times
3. No active awards would benefit from them
4. You've already achieved all awards

**Solutions:**
- Check application log to see if SKCC roster loaded correctly
- Verify your SKCC number is set correctly
- Check award progress in the Awards tab

### Q: The color changed - why?

**Possible reasons:**
1. You logged a new contact (eligibility cache updated)
2. 5 minutes passed and cache refreshed
3. Award progress changed (different eligibility)

**Typical scenario:**
- Spot was YELLOW (need 50 more)
- You work 10 more Centurion members
- Same spot (from new RBN cluster) is now ORANGE (need 40 more)

### Q: Can I focus on only RED spots?

**Yes!** Use filters:
- Check "Show CRITICAL" only
- Uncheck "Show HIGH" and "Show MEDIUM"
- This shows only your most urgent opportunities

### Q: What about non-SKCC members?

**Gray/no color** - they won't help with SKCC awards (Centurion, Tribune, Senator, Triple Key).

However:
- They might help with other awards (DXCC, WAS, WAC)
- Future versions may support these awards
- For now, ignore if pursuing SKCC awards

## Quick Setup

1. **Enter your callsign and SKCC number:**
   - Settings ‚Üí Operator ‚Üí Callsign & SKCC Number
   - Example: W4GNS, 14947T

2. **Confirm SKCC roster loaded:**
   - Should see message: "SKCC roster loaded (X members)"

3. **Turn on highlighting:**
   - RBN Spots tab ‚Üí Highlighting Options
   - ‚òëÔ∏è Enable Award-Relevant highlighting

4. **Start seeing colors!**
   - Next RBN spots will have highlighting based on your awards

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Color Intensity Matters
- Brighter = more important
- RED (bright) > ORANGE (medium) > YELLOW (faded)
- Helps your eye quickly spot priorities

### Tip 2: Multi-Op Events
- If running multi-op, set each operator's callsign/SKCC number
- Spotting shows their personal award priorities
- Each operator can see their own progress

### Tip 3: Award Strategy
- Focus on one award at a time
- When close to RED zone, hunt aggressively
- Saves time vs. random spotting

### Tip 4: Worked History
- GREEN spots = recently worked (good for testing setup)
- Use to verify highlighting is working
- If GREEN spots don't show = check highlighting settings
