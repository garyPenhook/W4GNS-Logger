# Award Actions - Update Complete

## Problem Resolved
User reported not seeing "Generate Application" option in each award's Actions section, unlike the Tribune award which already had it.

## Solution Implemented
Added action buttons to all 10 award progress widgets in the Awards tab:

### Updated Widgets
Each widget now has an **Actions** section with two buttons:

1. **Create Award Report** - Generate a detailed report for submission to award manager
2. **Generate Application** - Generate an application form for submission to award manager

### Awards Updated

✅ **Centurion** (centurion_progress_widget.py)
✅ **Tribune** (tribune_progress_widget.py) - Added "Generate Application" button
✅ **Senator** (senator_progress_widget.py)
✅ **WAS** (was_progress_widget.py)
✅ **WAC** (wac_progress_widget.py)
✅ **Canadian Maple** (canadian_maple_progress_widget.py)
✅ **DXCC** (dx_award_progress_widget.py)
✅ **Rag Chew** (rag_chew_progress_widget.py)
✅ **PFX** (pfx_progress_widget.py)
✅ **Triple Key** (triple_key_progress_widget.py)

## Features

### Each Action Button
- **Report Button**: Opens award_report_dialog pre-selected with that award type
- **Application Button**: Opens award_application_dialog pre-selected with that award type
- Both buttons have helpful tooltips
- Buttons use consistent styling and layout with main toolbar button

### Smart Defaults
When you click "Generate Application" from an award's Actions section:
- The AwardApplicationDialog opens
- The award dropdown is automatically pre-selected to that award
- Users can still change to a different award if needed

## Code Pattern
Each widget now includes:

```python
def _create_actions_section(self) -> QGroupBox:
    """Create actions section with report and application generation buttons"""
    group = QGroupBox("Actions")
    layout = QHBoxLayout()

    report_btn = QPushButton("Create Award Report")
    report_btn.setToolTip("Generate a [Award] award report to submit to the award manager")
    report_btn.clicked.connect(self._open_award_report_dialog)
    layout.addWidget(report_btn)

    app_btn = QPushButton("Generate Application")
    app_btn.setToolTip("Generate a [Award] award application to submit to the award manager")
    app_btn.clicked.connect(self._open_award_application_dialog)
    layout.addWidget(app_btn)

    layout.addStretch()
    group.setLayout(layout)
    return group

def _open_award_report_dialog(self) -> None:
    """Open award report dialog"""
    # Opens report dialog pre-selected with award type

def _open_award_application_dialog(self) -> None:
    """Open award application dialog"""
    # Opens application dialog pre-selected with award type
```

## UI Locations

Users can now generate reports and applications in two ways:

1. **From Awards Tab** → Click individual award's Actions buttons
2. **From Awards Tab Toolbar** → Click top-level "Generate Award Application" button

## Verification

✅ All 10 award widgets updated
✅ All syntax validated
✅ Consistent UI/UX with Tribune widget
✅ All buttons properly connected to dialogs
✅ Pre-selection of award type working correctly

## How It Works

**Example: Using Centurion Actions**

1. Go to Awards Tab → Centurion Tab
2. Scroll down to see **Actions** section
3. Click "Generate Application"
4. Dialog opens with "Centurion" pre-selected in dropdown
5. User can proceed to generate the application or switch to another award
6. Same process for "Create Award Report" button
