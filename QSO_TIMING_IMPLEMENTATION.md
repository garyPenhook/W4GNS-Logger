# QSO Timing Implementation - Complete

**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE & TESTED
**Feature:** Automatic QSO start/end time tracking

---

## Overview

The W4GNS Logger now automatically tracks QSO (contact) start and end times:

- **Start Time (time_on):** Automatically recorded when a callsign is entered and remains stable for 5 seconds
- **End Time (time_off):** Automatically recorded when the "Save Contact" button is pressed
- **ADIF Export:** Both times are included in the contact record

---

## How It Works

### QSO Start Time Detection (time_on)

When a user enters a callsign and leaves it unchanged for 5 seconds, the application automatically records the start time:

```
User enters: K5ABC
           ↓
Timer starts (5 seconds)
           ↓
No changes for 5 seconds
           ↓
START TIME RECORDED: 14:30:00
```

### QSO End Time Detection (time_off)

When the user clicks "Save Contact", the end time is automatically recorded and contact is saved with both times.

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

**src/ui/logging_form.py** (~100 new lines)

**Key Changes:**
1. Added imports: `datetime`, `timedelta`, `QTimer`
2. Added instance variables for timing tracking
3. Connected callsign input to `_on_callsign_changed()` signal
4. Implemented `_on_callsign_stable()` to record start time
5. Implemented `_get_qso_times()` to return start/end times
6. Updated `save_contact()` to include `time_off`
7. Updated `clear_form()` to reset timing

---

## ADIF Format

Both `TIME_ON` and `TIME_OFF` fields included in ADIF:

```
QSO_DATE:8:D:20251021
TIME_ON:4:N:1430       # Start time (14:30)
TIME_OFF:4:N:1435      # End time (14:35)
CALL:5:S:K5ABC
BAND:3:E:40M
MODE:3:E:CW
...
```

---

## Usage Example

**14:30:00** - User starts entering callsign
```
Callsign: K5ABC (typed over 5 seconds)
```

**14:30:05** - Callsign stable for 5 seconds
```
✓ QSO START TIME RECORDED: 14:30
```

**14:35:42** - User clicks Save
```
✓ QSO END TIME RECORDED: 14:35
✓ Contact saved with time_on=1430, time_off=1435
```

## Features

✅ Automatic start time (5-second stable callsign)
✅ Automatic end time (on Save)
✅ ADIF-format output (HHMM)
✅ Proper error handling
✅ Reset on form clear
✅ Always-running timer
✅ Tested and working

---

## Database Integration

Contact model already has `time_on` and `time_off` fields:

```python
time_on = Column(String(4))    # "HHMM" format
time_off = Column(String(4))   # "HHMM" format
```

Both fields are automatically saved with every contact.
