# Space Weather Integration - Fix Summary

## Problem
The space weather widget could not access data from NOAA SWPC endpoints because the API endpoints had changed and were returning 404 errors.

## Root Cause
The original implementation used outdated NOAA SWPC API endpoints:
- ❌ `https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/products/noaa-estimates.json` (404)
- ❌ `https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/products/noaa-solar-data.json` (404)

These endpoints no longer exist or have been restructured.

## Solution
Updated to use current, working NOAA SWPC endpoints:

### Endpoints Now Used
1. **NOAA Scales Endpoint** (Working)
   ```
   https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/products/noaa-scales.json
   ```
   Provides:
   - Current and 3-day forecast geomagnetic scales (G-scale: 0-5)
   - Radio blackout scales (R-scale)
   - Solar radiation scales (S-scale)
   - Timestamps for all data

2. **K-Index Forecast Endpoint** (Working)
   ```
   https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/products/noaa-planetary-k-index-forecast.json
   ```
   Provides:
   - Current and 3-day K-index forecast
   - Observed vs. predicted data distinction
   - 3-hourly updates
   - NOAA scale classifications

## Changes Made

### File: `src/services/space_weather_fetcher.py`
- Updated endpoint URLs to working NOAA services
- Rewrote `get_current_conditions()` to parse NOAA scales JSON
- Rewrote `get_k_index_forecast()` to handle CSV-style array format
- Rewrote `get_solar_data()` to extract R-scale and S-scale data
- Added proper error handling for different data structures
- Added type hints and documentation

### File: `src/ui/space_weather_widget.py`
- Updated `_update_ui()` to work with new data structure
- Uses K-index for propagation assessment
- Displays geomagnetic scale (G-scale) instead of A-index
- Shows radio blackout and solar radiation scales
- Improved error messages and fallback handling

### File: `src/ui/main_window.py`
- Already included space weather tab integration
- No changes needed

## Current Data Available

### Real-Time Data
- **K-Index (Kp)**: Current geomagnetic disturbance level (0-9 scale)
- **Geomagnetic Scale**: NOAA classification (0-5, where 0=quiet, 5=extreme)
- **Radio Blackout Scale**: Current radio frequency impacts
- **Solar Radiation Scale**: Solar particle event level

### Forecasts (3-Day)
- 12-hour K-index forecasts
- Expected scales for each day
- Observation vs. prediction labels

## HF Propagation Assessment

The widget automatically assesses HF propagation based on K-index:

| K-Index | Status | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|---|
| < 3     | ✓ Excellent | Ideal for HF DX |
| 3-4     | ✓ Good | Good DX conditions |
| 4-5     | Fair | Suitable for normal operation |
| 5-6     | Unsettled | Increasing disturbance |
| 6-7     | Disturbed | Reduced DX propagation |
| > 7     | Storm | Severe HF degradation |

## Band Recommendations

The widget provides intelligent band recommendations:
- **10m**: Only good with high SFI + stable K-index
- **15m**: Good for most conditions
- **20m**: Always available (most reliable)
- **40m**: Excellent (works in any K-index)
- **80/160m**: Best during geomagnetic storms

## Testing

All functionality verified:
```
✓ TEST 1: Fetching current space weather conditions... PASS
✓ TEST 2: Fetching K-index forecast... PASS
✓ TEST 3: Fetching solar data... PASS
```

## Usage

1. Launch W4GNS Logger
2. Click the **"Space Weather"** tab
3. View:
   - Current space weather status (color-coded)
   - K-index with visual progress bar
   - Geomagnetic scale information
   - Radio and solar activity status
   - HF band recommendations
4. Data auto-refreshes every 30 minutes
5. Click "Refresh Now" button for immediate update

## Data Freshness

- NOAA updates their scales every 3 hours
- K-index forecasts update every 3 hours
- Widget caches data for 1 hour to minimize API calls
- Configurable refresh intervals available

## Benefits for HF Operations

Before making a DX contact attempt, operators can now:
1. **Check current conditions** - Green indicator = good DX conditions
2. **Monitor K-index** - Know if propagation is degrading
3. **See band recommendations** - Which bands to try now
4. **Plan operations** - Know when conditions will improve

## Additional Notes

- All data comes directly from NOAA SWPC (official US government space weather service)
- No authentication required
- Free and publicly available
- Reliable, tested endpoint
- Appropriate user agent headers included in requests
- Proper error handling for network issues
