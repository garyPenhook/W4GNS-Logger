# Award Applications Folder - Implementation

## What Was Changed

Created a centralized folder for all award reports and applications generated by the W4GNS Logger.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Folder Structure
```
award_applications/
├── .gitkeep              (keeps folder in git)
└── README.md             (folder documentation)
```

### 2. Updated Export Functions

**File: `src/ui/dialogs/award_report_dialog.py`**
- Modified `_export_report()` method
- Now defaults to `award_applications/` folder
- Full path: `{project_root}/award_applications/`

**File: `src/ui/dialogs/award_application_dialog.py`**
- Modified `_export_application()` method
- Now defaults to `award_applications/` folder
- Full path: `{project_root}/award_applications/`

## Behavior

### Before
- Export dialog opened in current working directory
- User had to navigate to desired location
- Files scattered across filesystem

### After
- Export dialog opens directly in `award_applications/` folder
- Pre-populated with suggested filename
- User can still browse to different location if desired
- All files centralized for easy organization

## File Naming Convention

### Reports
```
{award_name}_report_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.{extension}
Examples:
  tribune_report_20251028_143000.txt
  centurion_report_20251028_143500.csv
  was_report_20251028_144000.html
```

### Applications
```
{award_name}_application_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.{extension}
Examples:
  tribune_application_20251028_143200.txt
  centurion_application_20251028_143700.csv
```

## Benefits

✅ **Organized** - All award files in one location
✅ **Discoverable** - Easy to find recent exports
✅ **Centralized** - No files scattered across filesystem
✅ **Archived** - Easy to backup monthly
✅ **Flexible** - User can still choose different location
✅ **Timestamped** - Files include generation timestamp

## Usage

1. Open W4GNS Logger
2. Navigate to Awards tab
3. Click "Generate Award Report" or "Award Application"
4. Select award type and format
5. Click "Generate"
6. Click "Export"
7. File dialog opens to `award_applications/` folder
8. Auto-named file (can be changed)
9. Click "Save"
10. File saved to `award_applications/` (or your chosen location)

## Directory Path

**Project Root:** `/home/w4gns/apps/W4GNS Logger/`
**Awards Folder:** `/home/w4gns/apps/W4GNS Logger/award_applications/`

## Git Integration

- `.gitkeep` file ensures folder is tracked in version control
- Folder will persist even if empty
- README.md documents the folder purpose

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes

**award_report_dialog.py - _export_report() method:**
```python
# Default to award_applications folder in project root
from pathlib import Path
project_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent.parent
award_apps_dir = project_root / "award_applications"
award_apps_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# Get save path (default to award_applications folder)
file_path, _ = QFileDialog.getSaveFileName(
    self,
    "Export Report",
    str(award_apps_dir / suggested_name),
    f"Report Files (*.{extension});;All Files (*.*)"
)
```

**award_application_dialog.py - _export_application() method:**
Same pattern as above for consistency.

## Testing

✅ Syntax validation: PASSED
✅ Code compiles: YES
✅ Folder created: YES
✅ Documentation: COMPLETE

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Award applications folder implemented and integrated

## Next Steps

1. Users can immediately start using the feature
2. Award exports default to `award_applications/` folder
3. Reports and applications auto-organized by timestamp
4. Folder grows with each export (easy to cleanup/archive)

## Notes

- Folder is created automatically if it doesn't exist
- User permissions allow reading/writing
- Compatible with existing export functionality
- Non-breaking change to existing system
